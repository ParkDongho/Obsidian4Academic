abstract: We present FireSim, an open-source simulation platform that enables cycle-exact
  microarchitectural simulation of large scale-out clusters by combining FPGA-accelerated
  simulation of silicon-proven RTL designs with a scalable, distributed network simulation.
  Unlike prior FPGA-accelerated simulation tools, FireSim runs on Amazon EC2 F1, a
  public cloud FPGA platform, which greatly improves usability, provides elasticity,
  and lowers the cost of large-scale FPGA-based experiments. We describe the design
  and implementation of FireSim and show how it can provide sufficient performance
  to run modern applications at scale, to enable true hardware-software co-design.
  As an example, we demonstrate automatically generating and deploying a target cluster
  of 1,024 3.2 GHz quad-core server nodes, each with 16 GB of DRAM, interconnected
  by a 200 Gbit/s network with 2 microsecond latency, which simulates at a 3.4 MHz
  processor clock rate (less than 1,000x slowdown over real-time). In aggregate, this
  FireSim instantiation simulates 4,096 cores and 16 TB of memory, runs ~14 billion
  instructions per second, and harnesses 12.8 million dollars worth of FPGAs—at a
  total cost of only ~$100 per simulation hour to the user. We present several examples
  to show how FireSim can be used to explore various research directions in warehouse-scale
  machine design, including modeling networks with high-bandwidth and low-latency,
  integrating arbitrary RTL designs for a variety of commodity and specialized datacenter
  nodes, and modeling a variety of datacenter organizations, as well as reusing the
  scale-out FireSim infrastructure to enable fast, massively parallel cycle-exact
  single-node microarchitectural experimentation.
