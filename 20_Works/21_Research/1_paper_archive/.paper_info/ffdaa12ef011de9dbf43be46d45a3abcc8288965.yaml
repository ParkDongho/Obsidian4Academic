abstract: Eyeriss is an accelerator for state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural
  networks (CNNs). It optimizes for the energy efficiency of the entire system, including
  the accelerator chip and off-chip DRAM, for various CNN shapes by reconfiguring
  the architecture. CNNs are widely used in modern AI systems but also bring challenges
  on throughput and energy efficiency to the underlying hardware. This is because
  its computation requires a large amount of data, creating significant data movement
  from on-chip and off-chip that is more energy-consuming than computation. Minimizing
  data movement energy cost for any CNN shape, therefore, is the key to high throughput
  and energy efficiency. Eyeriss achieves these goals by using a proposed processing
  dataflow, called row stationary (RS), on a spatial architecture with 168 processing
  elements. RS dataflow reconfigures the computation mapping of a given shape, which
  optimizes energy efficiency by maximally reusing data locally to reduce expensive
  data movement, such as DRAM accesses. Compression and data gating are also applied
  to further improve energy efficiency. Eyeriss processes the convolutional layers
  at 35 frames/s and 0.0029 DRAM access/multiply and accumulation (MAC) for AlexNet
  at 278 mW (batch size  $N = 4$ ), and 0.7 frames/s and 0.0035 DRAM access/MAC for
  VGG-16 at 236 mW ( $N = 3$ ).
